# solar-challenge-week0🌞

This project is part of the **10 Academy Artificial Intelligence Mastery Program (Week 0 Challenge)**.  
It focuses on exploring solar radiation data from **Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo** to identify high-potential areas for solar energy production.

## 💡 About the Project
As a candidate in the 10 Academy program, I worked on this challenge to strengthen my skills in **Python, Git, and data analysis**.  
The main goal is to clean, explore, and compare solar datasets across countries and extract meaningful insights that could guide solar farm development.
