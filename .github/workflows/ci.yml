# 1. Define the name of the workflow
name: CI

# 2. Define the Triggers (Fixes the "no event triggers defined" error)
# This tells GitHub to run the workflow when you push to main or setup-task, 
# or when you create a pull request targeting main.
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, setup-task ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# 3. Define the jobs (what the workflow should do)
jobs:
  build:
    # Use the latest version of the Ubuntu Linux runner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # Define a matrix to test on multiple Python versions (optional, but good practice)
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [ '3.9' ] # You can add '3.10', '3.11' later

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      # Step 2: Set up the Python environment
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      # Step 3: Install dependencies (This is the step from your instructions)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          
      # Step 4: Run a check (e.g., a linter or a simple command)
      # This step is often used to run tests, but for a basic check, we can run a simple command.
      # You can replace the 'echo' with your actual test command later (e.g., 'pytest').
      - name: Basic check / placeholder for tests
        run: |
          echo "CI check successful up to installation step."
