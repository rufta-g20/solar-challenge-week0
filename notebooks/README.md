# Notebooks Folder

This folder contains all exploratory and analytical notebooks for each country.

- **benin_eda.ipynb** — EDA for Benin dataset  
- **sierra_leone_eda.ipynb** — EDA for Sierra Leone dataset  
- **togo_eda.ipynb** — EDA for Togo dataset  

Each notebook follows the same analytical workflow:
1. Load raw data  
2. Clean and impute missing values  
3. Detect and handle outliers  
4. Perform exploratory visual analysis  
5. Export cleaned datasets

All notebooks use shared helper scripts from the `scripts/` folder to ensure reproducibility and modularity.
